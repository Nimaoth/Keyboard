# Keyboard Layouts

This repository contains AutoHotkey scripts which change the keyboard layout

## Neo
This script converts a qwertz layout to a custom layout inspired by the Neo layout. It remaps letters and characters which are often used in programming. It also makes it possible to use the arrow keys and a few other keys directly on the main keyboard, allowing the user to quickly navigate through text.
